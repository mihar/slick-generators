Description:
    The slick_layout generator creates a basic stylesheet and layout
    which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

    Basically you just run this generator, to get a basic 
    application.html.haml layout, that has the doctype 
    and common features such as the title yielding and other 
    structural elements.

    You also get several SASS stylesheet files that provide basic styling
    functionality, such as reseting the browser styles, common form styling,
    and separation of head, menu, content, foot, common styles in seperate
    files.

    An application wide helpers is also included, with several common methods
    for including javascript, setting the title, and so forth.

Options:
    --no-style  No SASS file will be made.

Examples:
    ./script/generate slick_layout

        This will create several files:
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.haml
            Stylesheets:
                Main:   public/stylesheets/sass/application.sass
                Head:   public/stylesheets/sass/head.sass
                Menu:   public/stylesheets/sass/head.sass
               Content: public/stylesheets/sass/content.sass
                Head:   public/stylesheets/sass/head.sass
                Common: public/stylesheets/sass/common.sass
                Forms:  public/stylesheets/sass/forms.sass
                Admin:  public/stylesheets/sass/admin.sass
            Helper:     app/helpers/application_helper.rb


    ./script/generate slick_layout --no-style

        This will create one file:
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.haml
            Helper:     app/helpers/application_helper.rb
